# Devplan CLI

A command-line interface for Devplan that helps automate development workflows.

## Version

You can check the current version of the CLI by running:

```bash
devplan version
```

## Self-Update

The CLI can update itself to the latest production version or to a specific version.

### Update to the latest production version

```bash
devplan update
```

### Update to a specific version

```bash
devplan update --to=1.2.3
```

### List available versions

```bash
devplan update --list
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

You can install Devplan CLI using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap devplaninc/tap
brew install devplan
```

### Manual Installation

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/devplaninc/devplan-cli/releases).

## Development Set up

### Private Github repo

We depend on github.com/devplaninc/webapp, which is a private repo. For that to work:

1. Add following into your `~/.gitconfig` file:
```
[url "git@github.com:devplaninc/webapp.git"]
 insteadOf = https://github.com/devplaninc/webapp
```
2. Set up repo
```
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/devplaninc/webapp
go mod tidy
```

### Building with version information

The CLI uses build-time flags to embed version information. When building locally, you can use:

```bash
make build
```

This will set the version to "dev" for local development builds.

### Releasing a new version

1. Create and push a new tag with a semantic version (e.g., `v1.2.3`):
```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

2. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the release.

### Marking a version as production

After a version has been released and tested, you can mark it as the production version:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Actions â†’ Mark Version as Production
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version number (without the 'v' prefix, e.g., "1.2.3")
5. Click "Run workflow"

This will update the production version file in the Digital Ocean Space, and users will be able to update to this version using `devplan update`.
